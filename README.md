# Javascript_timer
A simple landing page built with html, Css, and Javascript
So yesterday, I learnt about the setInterval method, The setTime out, and the Date object, and decided to build a simple javascript timer. The moon clock was made with pure Css3 and Neumorphic Css, and the timer was made with javascript date object and methods. I hope you like it.
